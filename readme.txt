To start application, install dependencies then run 'py main.py' in terminal

You can add a gesture by adding the gestures name on a new line in gestures.txt
You can capture data for a gesture by running the app and pressing 'K' to enter capture mode
Pressing a number in this mode will capture and store the data for the current held up gesture associating that gesture with the corresponding gesture name in gestures.txt by index.
For example: if the first gesture name in gestures.txt is 'Wave', then entering capture mode and pressing 0 will save the current held up gesture and associate it with 'Wave'
