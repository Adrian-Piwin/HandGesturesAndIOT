To start application, install dependencies then run 'py main.py' in terminal

You can add a gesture by adding the gestures name on a new line in gestures.txt
You can capture data for a gesture by running the app and pressing 'K' to enter capture mode
Pressing a number in this mode will capture and store the data for the current held up gesture associating that gesture with the corresponding gesture name in gestures.txt by index.
For example: if the first gesture name in gestures.txt is 'Wave', then entering capture mode and pressing 0 will save the current held up gesture and associate it with 'Wave'


For the frontend to connect with the backend, run the server.py. From terminal or IDE.
For the gestures recognition with webcam to work, you'll need to plug arduino and the webcam to your pc and run the main.py.
For the frontend to work, run the code using npm start by going into the react code directory.
